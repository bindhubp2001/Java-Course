1. Java is a tool used to write, run and execute the program which is written in editor
   javac is a complier used to compile the code --> this convert machine code to bytecode which can be understand by jvm

2. JDK - java development kit - which consist of tool that run and execute java code
   JRE - java runtime environment - execute the program
   JVM - java virtual machine - JVM is the only tool that understand bytecode and convert it into machine code

3. Arrays - Store and Retrive Series of elements of same data type
            memory allocated in sequence 
	    index start from 0 
	     ex - int[] data = {10,20,30}; 
   Limitations :  we cannot store elements of different data type ,  size is fixed cannot be changes.

4. class - Class is a instance of object and it is a blueprint to create a object
	    it is a keyword
           class ClassName{}	//class declaration

  object - anything that exist in the real world
           and it as 2 memebers
           * state (info,properties) 
           * behoviour (methods,functionalities)

5. .java file consist of text code(english)
   .class file consist of bytecode 

6. methods - set of instructions
   2types
   1. static method - can be access from other classes
   2. non static method  - cannot be acees from other classes

   ex - static void run(){
          int a=10;
          sop(a)
           }//method defination;
         
	static void walk();//method declaration

7. java is a high level programming language used to interact with the computer				
   it is popular beacause of its features mainly
	* platform independent - write once read anywhere(in defferent os)
	* Multithraeding - multi users can access the information simultaneously

8. Java IDE's - Notepad++, 
		VSCode, 
		Eclipse, 
		intelliJ....and some online compilers(programize, w3school....)

9. variables - variables are used to store the informations and properties of object in the real world
   Types - static(class) and non-static(instance)
	syntax - dataType variable name = initialization;

         ex : int a =9;(here a is variable)

10. class varialbe means variable that is declared within the body of the class.

11. Data Types - Type of data need to be store in variable
    Types - primitive and non Primitive
    primitive data type - int (used to integer values of range -3million to 3million)
                          byte (used to store numbers of range -128 to 127)
			  short (used to store numbers of range -32657 to 32656)
			  long (used to store values of range -9million to 9million)
 			  char (used to store single character within single quotes('')charachter may be alpahbets , numbers, special characters..)
			  boolean (used to store true or false values)
			  float (used to store decimal values)
			  double (used to store decimal values)

    non primitive data type - which are dirrived from primitive data types 
                          Array - used to store sequence values of same data type 
			  String - used to store sequence of characters ("")

12.Java Features - Easy to code
 		   Object oriented - Representing object as program
		   Platform Independent
		   Multi Threading
		   Portable
     		   Open Source
		   secure
		   

13. Main class is the Base Class of All Classes.

14. methods - set of instructions
   1. static method
   2. non static method

   ex - static void run(){
          int a=10;
          sop(a)
           }//method defination;
         
	static void walk();//method declaration

15. class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){

	
	MainRunner.information("Bindhu",22);//Method Invoking from other Class

	System.out.println("Runnig main in java");
	int id = 100;	//VARIABLE DECLARATION
	String candidate = "Bindhu";
	char gender = 'F';

	System.out.println(id);
	System.out.println(candidate);
	System.out.println(gender);

	String[] friends = {"Joy","Rachel","Ross","Chandler","Monica","phoebhi"};
	
	//FOR LOOP

	for(int i=0; i<friends.length-1; i++)	//printing names in forward direction
	{
		System.out.println(friends[i]);
	}

        
	for(int i=friends.length-1; i>=0; i--)	//printing names in reverse direction
	{
		System.out.println(friends[i]);
	}

	//IF ELSE

	if(friends[0] == "Joy")
	{
		System.out.println("Joy name is placed in first position);
	}
	else if(friends[1] == "Joy")
	{
		System.out.println("Joy name is placed in second position);
	}
	else if(friends[2] == "Joy")
	{
		System.out.println("Joy name is placed in third position);
	}
	else if(friends[3] == "Joy")
	{
		System.out.println("Joy name is placed in fourth position);
	}	
	else if(friends[4] == "Joy")
	{
		System.out.println("Joy name is placed in fifth position);
	}
	else if(friends[5] == "Joy")
	{
		System.out.println("Joy name is placed in sixth position);
	}
 	else
	{
		Sysem.out.println("Error");
	}

	//INVOKING METHOD OF SAME CLASS

	info("Varun");		//Implicit arguments
	String name = "Tej";	// explicit arguments
	info(name);
	
	}

	static void info(String name ){ 	//METHOD DECLARATION AND DEFINATION
		System.out.println("Name that is passed as arguments is : "+name);
	}
}

class MainRunner{
	static void information(String name,int age ){ //METHOD DECLARATION AND DEFINATION
		System.out.println("Name that is passed as arguments is : "+name);
		System.out.println("Age that is passed as arguments is : "+age);
	}
}
